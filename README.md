**This repository contains a full-stack web application that aims to replicate the core functionalities of the popular social networking platform, X (formerly Twitter). Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), this project showcases a modern approach to building interactive and real-time social media experiences.**

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JWT for session management.
* **Post Creation & Management:** Users can create, read, and delete their own posts.
* **Like System:** Users can like posts, providing a way to engage with content.
* **Comment System:** Users can add and view comments on posts, fostering discussions.
* **Basic Feed Display:** A timeline displaying posts from all users.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be accessible and functional across various devices.
* **Clean and Intuitive UI:** A user interface built with React, aiming for a familiar and engaging experience.

## üíª Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18 or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) - Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/abdussameea1813/X.git](https://github.com/abdussameea1813/X.git)
    cd X
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    * Add the following environment variables (replace with your actual values):
        ```env
        PORT=5000
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_secret_jwt_key
        ```

5.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The backend server should start on port 5000 (or the port you specified).

6.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application should be accessible in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).
